# GeoFedNet - Federated Learning for Seismic Interpretation  

## Overview  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of **GeoFedNet**, a federated learning framework designed for **seismic structural interpretation**. The code can be executed using **Kaggle, Google Colab, or Jupyter Notebook**.  

## Project Information  
GeoFedNet aims to enhance model generalization while preserving **data privacy** in seismic interpretation. The key contributions of this research include:  

- **Proposing GeoFedNet**, a federated learning framework tailored for seismic structural interpretation.  
- **Evaluating the framework** on three seismic interpretation applications across four different datasets.  
- **Demonstrating competitive performance**, showing that GeoFedNet achieves accuracy comparable to centralized models while ensuring data confidentiality.  

## Getting Started  

### Requirements  
Ensure you have the following installed:  

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / Kaggle  
- TensorFlow, Keras, or any required ML framework (as specified in the notebook)  

### Execution  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GeoFedNet.git
   cd GeoFedNet

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

- Locally: jupyter notebook GeoFedNet.ipynb

- On Colab: Upload the notebook to Google Colab.

- On Kaggle: Upload the notebook to a Kaggle notebook environment.
